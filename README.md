## Welcome to my first Capstone Project!

The name of my project is **The Sports App**.  Here is the url: [The Sports App](https://sports-app-capstone.herokuapp.com/)

The website is for users to pick their favorite sports teams to follow from a list of several different sports.  They can also add notes for each team.  

After the user signs up, they will be give a drop down of sports to chose from.  After a sport is chosen , they will select a league from that drop down and then select a favorite team from a third drop down.  The user's favorite teams will be saved and basic information about that team will be displayed.

The user can click on a More Info/Notes button that will take them to a page that displays more information about that team and allow the user to make notes and save them.

The user can also click a delete button to no longer keep this team as a favorite.

When the user logs back in, the teams they have chosen to follow will appear where they can again, choose more teams to follow.

Here is what the page looks like for a user after they log in and have teams they are following:

The API I used for this project is this url: [Sports App API](https://www.thesportsdb.com/api.php)

I wanted to display basic information about a user's favorite teams and then allow them to click on a button to display more information about the team so that I could use more endpoints from the API.  I am a big sports fan so this was a fun API to use in order to tackle my first capstone project.
